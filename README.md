# YARA Rules
Repository where I've compiled a master list of YARA rules scraped from multiple sources. The file has hundres of YARA rules from several vendors. I am still currently adding more YARA rules to this file, but I have put it here as a starter file. This file can be ingested into SSA without any errors, but I have had to cut out or modify some of the rules to make it work.

## Sources
For a more complete source of YARA rules that don't necessarily need to be changed or deleted to be ingested, you can find them at this github repository:
